This module contains a comprehensive suite of tests for this server.

The TEST_SPECS.md contains test specification. For each test, it details what is the precondition, the action, and the expected results.
The Specs was generated by Claude Opus4.5, and should be given additional review.

The Implementation is is tests/api and tests/ee. Again, all tests were generated by Claude Agents. Most of api tests were heavily mocked with fake classes to speed up tests. Extensive review for every case wasn't conducted. An automated review (again, by Claude), produces tests/audits/*.md, that details the compliance of tests against the specs.

Only the ee tests were actually reviewed. Api tests should be reviewed more carefully at a later time~.
